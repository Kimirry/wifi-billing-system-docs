Welcome to the official documentation for the **Litch DevOps Wi-Fi Billing System**.  
This guide provides users and administrators with instructions on how to use and manage the system safely and effectively, without revealing sensitive technical details or internal logic.

---

## Overview

The Wi-Fi Billing System allows users to access the internet by purchasing secure Wi-Fi packages. User sessions are automatically managed: access is granted after payment and terminated when the session expires.  

Administrators can monitor connected users, track revenue, and manage packages through a secure dashboard. All internal operations remain private to maintain system security.

---

## User Experience

Users connect to the Wi-Fi network and are redirected to a secure login and payment page. After selecting a package and completing payment, they gain internet access immediately. Sessions end automatically when the package limit (time or data) is reached, ensuring fair use.

For detailed instructions, see [User Workflow](usage.md).

## Administrator Experience

Administrators log in to a secure dashboard where they can:

- View active sessions and connected users  
- Track revenue from Wi-Fi packages  
- Manage available packages and pricing  
- Receive notifications for payments and session expirations  

The dashboard ensures safe system management without exposing sensitive credentials or payment logic.

---

## System Requirements

Users only need a Wi-Fi connection and access to the payment service. Administrators require a web browser to manage the system. Sensitive credentials and configurations remain private.

---
## Security & Maintenance

Security is a core focus. Only authorized administrators can access the dashboard. User sessions are automatically managed to prevent misuse, and all activity is logged securely. Payments are handled through verified services, and internal operations are never exposed.

---

## Troubleshooting & Support

Users unable to connect should check payment status or session validity. Payment issues are typically resolved by verifying account details. Administrators can review system logs and notifications to quickly address any issues.
